 <h1>Why is it Important to Take Care of Our Environment?</h1>
</div>
<hr class="h">

<li>We only have one earth as our home: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why is the environment important? Although some of us may take this lightly, it is critical to know that we don’t have anywhere else we can run to. If we spoil what we have here, we will suffer the consequences of our actions. If we take care of nature, then nature will also take care of us in return.
When we pollute the water sources, we are the ones who will lack clean water. If again we cut down all trees for our short-term goals, we will suffer global warming, lack of rainfall to grow our food, and many other adverse situations.
Therefore, if we love our lives, we must love nature.</li></br></br>
<li align="justify">Clean Environment Means Healthier Lives:&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe more we take care of our environment, the more we can have a cleaner and habitable home. If on the other hand, we neglect nature and undertake actions that harm it, the more difficulties we will have to access clean essentials like water, food, and shelter.</li></br></br>
<li align="justify">Rise In The Overall Earth’s Temperatures:&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEven just a minor increase in the atmospheric temperature can bring drastic changes in the weather patterns. If the average global temperatures rise, it means we will have changes in seasons which will affect both plants and animals.</li></br></br>
<li align="justify">Caring For The Environment Protects The Ecosystem And Humanity:&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlmost all our activities affect the ecosystem in one way or the other. If we negatively impact the ecosystem, we put various species on the verge of extinction. For example, if we pollute the water bodies with plastic or leaked oil, we kill the species that live there.</li> </br>
</br>
<li align="justify">Biodiversity is Essential:&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe term biodiversity stands for the availability of different types of animals, plants and other organisms in the world. Biodiversity offers us the chance to get everything we require for survival. Based on a study by EPA, biodiversity can easily be affected by both human activities and natural forces.</li></br></br>
<li align="justify">The Environment Provides Various Raw Materials And Habitats:&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe various things we use like furniture, rubber, food, and shelter, among others, comes from raw materials we get from forests. Deforestation, therefore, means that we are at risk of lacking such essential materials.</li></br></br>
<li align="justify">Protecting The Environment is An Excellent Way to Give Back:&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne indisputable thing is that we only live because nature offers us resources. Whether we want to hear it or not, if nature is gone, we will also disappear with it. Therefore, caring for the environment is a great way to show that we care and appreciate it.</li></br></br>
